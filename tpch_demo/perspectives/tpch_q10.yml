  The Returned Item Reporting Query finds the top 20 customers, in terms of
  their effect on lost revenue for a given quarter, who have returned parts. The
  query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The
  query lists the customer's name, address, nation, phone number, account
  balance, comment information and revenue

  lost. The customers are listed in descending order of lost revenue. Revenue
  lost is defined as

  sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems.
