  Business Question

  The Local Supplier Volume Query lists for each nation in a region the revenue
  volume that resulted from lineitem transactions in which the customer ordering
  parts and the supplier filling them were both within that nation. The query is
  run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in a
  given region. The query considers only parts ordered in a given year. The
  query displays the nations and revenue volume in descending order by revenue.
  Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined
  as sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))
