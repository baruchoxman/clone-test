  Volume Shipping Query (Q7)

  This query determines the value of goods shipped between certain nations to
  help in the re-negotiation of shipping

  contracts.


  Business Question

  The Volume Shipping Query finds, for two given nations, the gross discounted
  revenues derived from lineitems in which parts were shipped from a supplier in
  either nation to a customer in the other nation during 1995 and 1996. The
  query lists the supplier nation, the customer nation, the year, and the
  revenue from shipments that took place in that year. The query orders the
  answer by Supplier nation, Customer nation, and year (all ascending).
